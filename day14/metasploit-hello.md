There are two shells
1. Bind shells
2. Reverse Shells


1. Bindshells:
    they ask target to open command and listen host. modern firewals block them

2. Reverse Shells:
    The host creates ports itself rather asking target. this can also be blocked by firewall but who configure outbound connection!!!
